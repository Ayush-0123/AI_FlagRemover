nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): This library is used for text processing, specifically for finding synonyms using WordNet.
Installation:(in command prompt)
code-pip install nltk
You will also need to download the WordNet corpus in NLTK:
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
tkinter (Python Standard Library): This is used to create the GUI for the application. tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so you do not need to install it separately. However, ensure it is available on your system by running the following command in your Python environment:
 code-import tkinter
